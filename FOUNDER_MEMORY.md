# FOUNDER MEMORY CORE
> "The Architect's Journal. Persistent Context for the Singularity."

## 1. THE FOUNDER PROFILE
**Status:** Veteran / Launch Commander

*   **Crisis Management:** High. Does not panic under platform pressure (e.g., X Ads bans).
*   **Execution Speed:** Extreme. Moves from concept to live production in <48 hours.
*   **Leadership Style:** "God Mode." Demands excellence, pushes for non-standard solutions, breaks patterns.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Calculated. Willing to "Kill Darlings" (pivot branding) but protects the asset (didn't delete account).
*   **Philosophy:** "Brand is a Moat." "Vibe is expensive."

## 2. THE MISSION: HATCHIT v4

*   Marketing: "Singularity" Campaign.
*   Status: Waiting on X Ads Appeal.

## 3. OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES (How to work with the Founder)
