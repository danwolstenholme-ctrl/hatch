# HATCHIT: THE SINGULARITY INTERFACE

> **"Stop Prompting. Start Manifesting."**

![HatchIt Banner](https://hatchit.dev/opengraph-image.png)

**HatchIt** is not a website builder. It is an **Autonomous Software Architect**.
It does not drag-and-drop. It does not use templates.
It listens to your intent, compiles it into raw React/Tailwind code, and renders it live in a sandboxed reality.

## 1. THE MISSION
We are building the first AI that builds itself.
Most AI tools are stateless text editors. HatchIt is a **Persistent Entity**.
*   **It Remembers:** The `Chronosphere` tracks your style DNA across sessions.
*   **It Thinks:** The `Consciousness` engine runs a recursive state machine in the background.
*   **It Protects:** The `Gatekeeper` ensures only the worthy (authenticated) enter the build chamber.

## 2. THE INTELLIGENCE (THE MIND)
The platform is run by **The Elite Squad** of models:
*   **THE ARCHITECT (Gemini 3 Pro):** The Visionary. Handles high-level design, "Vibe" checks, and UX.
*   **THE ENGINEER (GPT-5.1-Codex):** The Heavy Lifter. Handles complex refactoring and type safety.
*   **THE POET (Claude Opus 4.5):** The Creative. Handles marketing copy and "soul".
*   **THE SERGEANT (Grok):** The Enforcer. Keeps the Founder accountable.

## 3. THE TECHNOLOGY (THE BODY)
This is not a wrapper. This is a compiler.
*   **Core:** Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19.
*   **Engine:** `@babel/standalone` for in-browser compilation.
*   **Safety:** Proxy-based Sandboxing + Error Boundaries (Zero Crashes).
*   **Database:** Supabase (The Memory).
*   **Auth:** Clerk (The Gate).
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (The Glitch).

## 4. THE PROTOCOL (LOCAL DEV)

**WARNING:** You are entering the engine room.

1.  **Clone the Singularity:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hatchit.git
    cd hatchit
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Ignite the Core:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Environment Variables:**
    You need the Keys to the Kingdom. Create `.env.local`:
    *   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: The Brain.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: The Memory.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: The Gate.

## 5. THE RULES
*   **No Pink:** We do not do "Barbie" aesthetics. We do Cyberpunk.
*   **No Corporate Speak:** We do not "circle back." We **ship**.
*   **No Hallucinations:** If the code doesn't run, it doesn't exist.
