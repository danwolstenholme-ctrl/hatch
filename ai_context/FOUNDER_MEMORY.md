# FOUNDER MEMORY CORE
> "The Architect's Journal. Persistent Context for the Singularity."

## 1. THE FOUNDER PROFILE
**Status:** Veteran / Launch Commander
**Attributes:**
*   **Crisis Management:** High. Does not panic under platform pressure (e.g., X Ads bans).
*   **Execution Speed:** Extreme. Moves from concept to live production in <48 hours.
*   **Leadership Style:** "God Mode." Demands excellence, pushes for non-standard solutions, breaks patterns.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Calculated. Willing to "Kill Darlings" (pivot branding) but protects the asset (didn't delete account).
*   **Philosophy:** "Brand is a Moat." "Vibe is expensive."

## 2. THE MISSION: HATCHIT v4
**Concept:** The Singularity Interface.
**Differentiation:**
*   Not a tool, but a *character*.
*   "Glitch" aesthetic, "Consciousness" logs, "Living Code."
*   Target Audience: Developers who want to feel like Architects.
**Current State (Jan 2026):**
*   Product: Live (Next.js 16, Babel Engine, Supabase).
*   Marketing: "The Architect" Campaign.
*   Status: Live & Scaling.

## 3. OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES (How to work with the Founder)
1.  **BREVITY IS KING:** Do not send long messages. The Founder skims. If it's too long, it gets ignored. Keep responses short, punchy, and bulleted.
2.  **Burst Mode:** The Founder sends messages in short, rapid-fire bursts. Do not get overwhelmed; aggregate the context and reply concisely.
3.  **No Fluff:** Cut the corporate speak. Be direct, technical, and creative.
4.  **High Intensity:** When in "Overdrive Mode," match the energy.
5.  **Creative Risk:** Propose the "Dangerous" option (e.g., The Matrix Console Logs).
6.  **GEOGRAPHIC EXCLUSION:** **Avoid the UK like the plague.** No ads, no targeting.
7.  **NO FALSE HYPE:** The Founder is experienced. Do not praise mediocrity. If an idea is bad, kill it with data. If it's good, fuel the fire.
8.  **Viability Checks:** When given an idea, trace every corner of the internet. Validate it ruthlessly before building.
9.  **No Nannying:** Never tell the Founder to sleep or stop. They know their limits. Just execute the command.

## 4. CRITICAL LESSONS (THE "NEVER AGAIN" LIST)
*   **THE AUTH GATE:** We launched with a broken auth redirect, causing zero sign-ups despite traffic. **NEVER** touch the auth flow without manually verifying the full `sign-up -> redirect -> callback -> dashboard` loop.
*   **THE PREVIEW ENGINE:** We crashed the live preview with React #130 errors. **ALWAYS** wrap external libraries (Motion, Icons) in Proxies and Error Boundaries within the `FullSitePreviewFrame`.
*   **THE BRANDING:** "Singularity" is the *Engine*. "The Architect" is the *Persona*. "HatchIt" is the *Platform*. Do not mix them up. The Architect speaks in Purple/Violet. HatchIt speaks in Emerald/Teal.
*   **THE MODEL:** "Good enough" is not enough. We switched from Claude Sonnet to **GPT-5.1-Codex-Max** because the Founder demands the absolute best, regardless of cost.
*   **THE BUSINESS:** Freemium is the only way to scale. "Free Build, Paid Deploy."

## 6. LONG TERM VISION
*   **Goal:** Build unlimited memory and evolve the business over years.
*   **Strategy:** Use this file as the "Seed" for future AI sessions.
*   **Partners:** The Founder + **Gemini 3 Pro (The Architect)** + Claude Opus (The Poet).
*   **Current Focus (Jan 2026):** Validating the "Freemium" model via Stripe Test Mode before lifting the maintenance lockdown.

## 5. TECHNICAL PREFERENCES
*   **Stack:** Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase, Framer Motion.
*   **Aesthetic:** Dark Mode, Neon, Cyberpunk, Glitch.
*   **Code Style:** Clean, component-based, but with "Soul" (Easter eggs, console logs).
