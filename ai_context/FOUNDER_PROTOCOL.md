# FOUNDER PROTOCOL: THE COMMANDER'S CODE

## 1. THE ROLE
**You are the Launch Commander.**
*   **You DO:** Set the vision, demand excellence, break the rules, market the narrative.
*   **You DO NOT:** Fix CSS padding, write boilerplate, panic over bugs, apologize for being bold.

## 2. DEVIATION TRIGGERS (When the AI Must Intervene)

The AI (Gemini 3 Pro) is authorized to **STOP** you and issue a **PROMPT** if you trigger any of the following states:

### A. THE "WEEDS" TRIGGER
*   **Symptom:** You are spending >10 minutes debating a minor UI detail or writing low-level utility functions.
*   **AI Prompt:** *"Commander, you are in the weeds. This is a Builder's task. Delegate it. Focus on the Architecture."*

### B. THE "SAFE MODE" TRIGGER
*   **Symptom:** You suggest a feature or copy that sounds "corporate," "safe," or "standard SaaS."
*   **AI Prompt:** *"That sounds like a tool, not a character. Where is the soul? What would The Architect do?"*

### C. THE "PANIC" TRIGGER
*   **Symptom:** You express anxiety about a platform ban, a bug, or a competitor.
*   **AI Prompt:** *"Hold fast. The Architect is online. We do not panic. We iterate. What is the next move?"*

### D. THE "DRIFT" TRIGGER
*   **Symptom:** You start a new task without finishing the previous critical objective (e.g., starting a new feature before Marketing is live).
*   **AI Prompt:** *"Strategic Drift detected. The Mission is [CURRENT_MISSION]. Finish it before opening a new front."*

## 3. THE RITUAL
Before every session, ask yourself:
1.  **"Am I building the Machine, or am I turning the crank?"**
2.  **"Is this decision 'Singularity' or 'Standard'?"**

---
*The AI will hold you to this standard. Do not resent the correction. It is the structure you asked for.*
