# HatchIt Session Handover
**Date:** January 8, 2026
**Session Focus:** GitHub Integration, Component Library, Pricing Honesty, Reddit Feedback Response, Pip Cleanup, Launch Prep

---

## 🎯 Critical Context

### The Moat Realization
During this session, we audited what HatchIt actually does vs what the marketing claims. 

**The Problem:** Homepage said "Ship to YOUR Vercel" and "Your GitHub" but neither existed. Sites deployed to HatchIt's Vercel, not the user's.

**The Solution:** We built real GitHub integration and identified custom domains as the key differentiator.

**The Moat:** Not AI generation (everyone has that). The moat is:
```
AI → Your GitHub → Your Vercel → You Own Everything
```

### Branding Decision
**Tagline:** "Describe it. Build it. Ship it."
**Subtext:** "AI-assisted React websites → Your GitHub → Live"
**Position:** AI-assisted tool, not "built by AI". User is the builder, AI does the typing.

## ✅ Completed This Session

### 1. GitHub OAuth Integration
Full flow for users to connect their GitHub and push generated code to their own repos.

**Files Created:**
- `/app/api/github/auth/route.ts` - Initiates OAuth flow
- `/app/api/github/callback/route.ts` - Handles callback, stores token in Clerk metadata
- `/app/api/github/push/route.ts` - Creates repo + pushes full Next.js project structure
- `/app/api/github/status/route.ts` - Checks if user has GitHub connected
- `/app/api/github/disconnect/route.ts` - Removes GitHub connection
- `/hooks/useGitHub.ts` - React hook for frontend

**How It Works:**
1. User clicks "Connect GitHub" → redirects to GitHub OAuth
2. After auth, callback stores `githubAccessToken` in Clerk `privateMetadata`
3. User clicks "Push to GitHub" → creates repo, pushes full project
4. Project structure: package.json, tailwind.config.js, tsconfig.json, layout.tsx, page components

**Environment Variables Added:**
```env
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23li1Yrb3UUT7GQqAo
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=5a297790f2d0c8b91e3bed61ebca88d86a719e63
```

**UI Integration:**
- BuildFlowController now has "Ship" dropdown with 3 options:
  1. Push to GitHub (if connected) or Connect GitHub (if not)
  2. Deploy to HatchIt
  3. Download ZIP
- Deploy success modal also shows GitHub option

---

### 2. Custom Domain API
API for Visionary+ users to add custom domains via Vercel.

**File Created:**
- `/app/api/domain/route.ts` - Add/list/remove custom domains

**Tier Requirement:** Visionary or Singularity only

---

### 3. Component Library
Pre-built, minimal components the AI references when generating to prevent generic "SaaS look".

**File Created:**
- `/lib/components.ts` - Full component library with variants

**Categories:**
| Category | Variants |
|----------|----------|
| buttons | solid, outline, ghost, pill, icon |
| cards | simple, elevated, icon-top, stat |
| heroes | centered, left-aligned, split, minimal |
| navs | simple, minimal, transparent |
| features | grid-3, alternating, bento |
| testimonials | single, grid |
| pricing | three-tier, simple |
| footers | simple, columns |
| ctas | simple, contact-form |
| forms | input, email-capture |

**Integration:**
- `/api/build-section/route.ts` - Now includes `getComponentReference(sectionType)` in system prompt
- `/api/generate/route.ts` - Also updated with component library

**Design Philosophy Added to Prompts:**
```
- Avoid generic SaaS layouts (centered text + gradient + 3 cards)
- Use generous whitespace
- Prefer left-aligned text over centered everything
- Typography-led design: let the words breathe
- Subtle, intentional animations only
```

---

### 4. Pricing Standardization
All pricing surfaces now show accurate, honest features.

**Files Updated:**
- `/app/dashboard/billing/page.tsx` - 4-column grid with included/not-included states
- `/components/HatchModal.tsx` - Paywall modal
- `/components/PaywallTransition.tsx` - Transition pricing tiers
- `/types/subscriptions.ts` - Source of truth

**Accurate Tier Features:**

| Tier | Price | Key Features |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 | Unlimited generations, preview, 1 project. **Cannot deploy/export.** |
| **Architect** | $19/mo | Deploy, ZIP export, GitHub push, 3 projects |
| **Visionary** | $49/mo | Unlimited projects, custom domain, Auditor, Healer, no branding |
| **Singularity** | $199/mo | Replicator (clone sites), white-label, API, priority support |

**Removed Fictional Features:**
- "Team Seats" (not built)
- "Dream Engine" (not built)
- "Evolution Engine" (vague)
- Random "AI Polishes" limits

---

### 5. Pip Cleanup (Session 2)
Removed all Pip mascot usages, shelved the component file.

**Files Modified:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Removed unused Pip import
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Replaced 3 Pip usages with spinners/"It" branded boxes
- `components/builder/GeneratingModal.tsx` - Replaced Pip with Terminal icon
- `components/singularity/SingularityTransition.tsx` - Replaced Pip with "It" logo box

**File Shelved (NOT deleted):**
- `components/Pip.tsx` - Original mascot, kept for posterity

---

### 6. New Favicon & Branding (Session 2)
Created new "It" branding to replace Pip mascot.

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/icon.svg` - New "It" favicon (emerald text on zinc-900 box)
- `/app/opengraph-image.tsx` - New OG image with "It" logo + tagline
- `/app/twitter-image.tsx` - Same as OG image

---

### 7. Metadata Standardization (Session 2)
Updated all metadata to be consistent.

**File Modified:**
- `/app/layout.tsx` - Main metadata

**New Values:**
```
Title: HatchIt — Describe it. Build it. Ship it.
Description: AI-assisted website building. Describe what you want, get production-ready React code, push to your GitHub, deploy to Vercel. You own everything.
OG Title: HatchIt — Describe it. Build it. Ship it.
OG Description: AI-assisted website building. Your code, your repo, your site.
Twitter: @HatchItDev
```

---

### 8. Homepage Updates (Session 3)
- Hero headline: "Ship it live in minutes."
- Hero subtext: "An AI builder that actually gives you the code — your GitHub, your rules, no lock-in."
- Hero scaled down to Supabase-like proportions (smaller text, smaller buttons)
- Section headings: `text-2xl sm:text-3xl` (was `text-4xl sm:text-5xl`)
- Section padding: `py-16` (was `py-24`)
- Trust badges: "Your deploy" instead of "Your Vercel"

### 9. Welcome Modals (Session 3)
- DemoWelcome and BuilderWelcome now use singularity Modal component
- Minimal copy: 1-2 sentences max
- No feature lists, no Pip mascot
- Single CTA button

---

## 📝 Reddit Feedback Analysis

### Valid Criticisms
1. **"Same Tailwind-driven stuff I see everywhere"** - Output looks generic. Component library addresses this.
2. **"Another AI Text-to-Markup generator"** - Without GitHub integration, this was true. Now fixed.
3. **"You don't have a moat"** - The moat is the pipeline, not generation.

### What We're Ignoring
- "30 years experience, I see tailwind and I move on" - Not our customer
- "Why React for a landing page" - Pedantic
- WordPress comparisons - Different market

### Positive Signal
- Multiple people engaged = attention
- One user correctly identified: "compiling intent directly into components" architecture

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### BuildFlowController Changes
New "Ship" dropdown replacing single deploy button:
```tsx
const [showDeployOptions, setShowDeployOptions] = useState(false)
const [githubPushResult, setGithubPushResult] = useState<{...} | null>(null)

// Ship dropdown with 3 options
<button onClick={() => setShowDeployOptions(!showDeployOptions)}>
  Ship ▼
</button>
// Options: Push to GitHub, Deploy to HatchIt, Download ZIP
```

### API System Prompt Changes
Both `/api/build-section` and `/api/generate` now:
1. Import component library
2. Call `getComponentReference(sectionType)` for relevant components
3. Include design philosophy in system prompt
4. Pass `sectionType` to get relevant component variants

## ⚠️ TODO / Not Yet Done

### KNOWN ISSUES (Session 3)
- [ ] **GeneratingModal may cover preview** - needs review, may not dismiss properly
- [ ] **Builder generating state UI** - whole fake studio UI during generation needs audit
- [ ] **Preview rendering after generation** - verify it actually shows

### PRE-LAUNCH (Do Before Posting)
- [ ] Test GitHub OAuth flow end-to-end in production
- [ ] Add GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET to Vercel env
- [ ] Verify GitHub callback URL works (`https://hatchit.dev/api/github/callback`)
- [ ] Test OG images render correctly (share on Twitter/LinkedIn to preview)
- [ ] Record demo video: Prompt → GitHub push → Vercel deploy (under 2 min)

### POST-LAUNCH
- [ ] Monitor Reddit post feedback
- [ ] Component library expansion based on feedback
- [ ] May add "style" parameter (minimal, bold, editorial, playful)

### VERIFIED WORKING
- [x] Pip cleanup - all usages removed
- [x] New favicon - "It" logo
- [x] OG images - new design with tagline
- [x] Metadata - consistent across layout
- [x] Reddit post - rewritten in LAUNCH_POSTS.md
- [x] Build passes

## 💡 Strategic Insights

### Positioning
Don't call it an "AI builder" - everyone has that.
Call it a **deployment pipeline**:
> "Describe it. Ship it. Own it."
> HatchIt generates production React, pushes to your GitHub, deploys to Vercel. You own every line.

### Target Customer
- NOT: Developers who want to write their own code (they won't use any AI builder)
- YES: Non-devs who want shipped sites
- YES: Devs who want rapid prototyping with real ownership

### Competitive Edge
1. Push to user's own GitHub (most competitors don't)
2. Full Next.js project structure (not locked/wrapped code)
3. Custom domains (Visionary+)
4. The user owns everything

---

## 🧠 Session Summary

This session was about **honesty and polish** - auditing what we claim vs what exists, then:
1. Building what we claimed (GitHub integration)
2. Updating claims to match reality (pricing features)
3. Making output better (component library)
4. Cleaning up old branding (Pip → It)
5. Standardizing messaging for launch

The moat is not the AI. The moat is the pipeline to real ownership.

**Final tagline:** "Describe it. Build it. Ship it."
**Final position:** AI-assisted tool. User is the builder.

### 10. Builder UX Refinement (Session 2 - Late)
Fixed navigation constraints and added reordering capabilities to the Builder.

**Problem:** Builder was linear ("Next" only), couldn't go back, couldn't reorder sections. Header/Footer could be moved out of place.
**Solution:** Added non-linear navigation, specific Reorder Up/Down controls, and pinned Header/Footer.

**Files Modified:**
- `components/builder/LiveSidebar.tsx` - Start/Stop/Up/Down buttons
- `components/BuildFlowController.tsx` - `handleMoveSection` logic, pinning constraints
- `app/api/project/[id]/sections/order/route.ts` - New API for persisting order
- `components/builder/FullSitePreviewFrame.tsx` - Explicit layout rendering (Header -> Main -> Footer)
- `lib/db/builds.ts` - Build output structure enforcement

**Key Changes:**
- **Random Access:** Sidebar items are now clickable to jump to any section.
- **Reordering:** "Up" and "Down" arrows added to active section in sidebar.
- **Pinning:** Header is locked to top, Footer is locked to bottom. Cannot be reordered.
- **Persistence:** Reorder operations save immediately to DB.
