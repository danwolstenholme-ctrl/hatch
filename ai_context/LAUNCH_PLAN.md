## CONVERSION FUNNEL

```
Visit → Try Demo → Sign Up → Build → Hit Paywall → Convert
  ↓       ↓           ↓        ↓         ↓           ↓
 100%    40%         15%      10%       8%          2%
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- Demo starts
- Sign-ups
- Projects created
- Sections built
- Deploy attempts (paywall hit)
- Conversions

### Optimization Points
1. **Demo → Sign-up**: Make the handoff seamless (fix that bug!)
2. **Sign-up → Build**: Onboarding, templates
3. **Build → Paywall**: Let them build enough to be invested
4. **Paywall → Convert**: Pricing page, urgency, value prop
