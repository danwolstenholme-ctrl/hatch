# HatchIt Launch Posts

**What is HatchIt? And why I built it.**

I've spent the last 200+ hours building something I needed to exist.

Here's the problem I kept hitting: I had projects to ship. Real ones. I tried WordPress/Elementor - functional, but dated. I moved to Figma's site deployment - they wrap content in noindex tags and use hash routing. SEO dead on arrival. I didn't research further. I started building.

**HatchIt is not an "AI website builder."**

It's a deployment pipeline. Here's what it actually does:

- **Generates production-ready HTML/CSS/JS** - not templates, not drag-and-drop blocks. Actual code you own.
- **One-click Vercel deployment** - connected to your GitHub, your domain, your infrastructure.
- **Full SEO control** - proper routing, meta tags, sitemaps, Open Graph. The things that actually matter.
- **Export and leave** - download your code anytime. No lock-in. No subscription required to keep your site live.
- **Free tier that actually works** - 3 generations per day. Build a complete landing page without paying anything.

The market is full of tools that generate "websites" you can't deploy, can't export, can't index. They're demos dressed as products.

HatchIt sits between Clerk, Supabase, and Vercel in my stack. It's the piece that was missing - rapid frontend generation that plugs into real infrastructure.

**What's coming:**
- Multi-page sites with proper navigation
- Form handling with Supabase integration
- Custom component library injection
- API endpoint generation

I've just incorporated Wolsten Studios in Cyprus. The thesis: help businesses actually ship in 2026 using the full capability of current tooling. HatchIt is the first product.

Currently in open beta. Free to use.

**Title: "Another AI text-to-markup generator" - fair. Here's what happens after the markup.**

Someone commented this on my last post and they're not wrong. The generation part is similar to everything else. Claude writes React + Tailwind. Cool. So does ChatGPT, Cursor, v0, and a dozen other tools.

Here's what I actually built differently:

**The pipeline after generation:**

1. You build sections (hero, features, pricing, whatever)
2. You hit "Push to GitHub" → it creates a repo in YOUR account
3. You hit "Deploy" → live on Vercel with YOUR infrastructure
4. Or download the ZIP → it's a full Next.js project you can run locally

That's it. That's the differentiator. You own the code. Not "export as HTML blob" - actual files in your actual repo.

**What I got tired of:**

- AI tools that generate code I can't deploy anywhere real
- Builders that lock my site behind their subscription
- "Export" buttons that give me minified garbage
- Platforms that inject noindex tags (looking at you, Figma Sites)

**What it actually does:**

- GitHub OAuth → pushes to your repo
- Vercel deployment API → your project, your domain
- ZIP export → full Next.js app with proper file structure
- Free tier that lets you build unlimited, pay when you want to ship

**Honest limitations:**

- The generation is Claude Sonnet 4. Same model everyone uses. Output quality depends on your prompts.
- It's still AI-generated code. You should review it.
- Multi-page sites work but the nav is basic right now.

Solo dev. Shipped over Christmas. Still iterating.

**Video proof coming:** Full flow from prompt → GitHub → Vercel in under 2 minutes. Will post in comments.

### Proof Points:
- 200+ hours development
- Solo built
- Used to build real projects
- Free tier works completely
- Export anytime, no lock-in
- Proper SEO (routing, meta, sitemaps)

### Founder Context:

## One-liner Options:

1. "HatchIt is a deployment pipeline, not a website builder."
2. "Generate → Deploy → Own. That's it."
3. "The missing piece between your idea and Vercel."
4. "Code generation that actually deploys."
5. "Build frontends. Ship to real infrastructure. Keep your code."
