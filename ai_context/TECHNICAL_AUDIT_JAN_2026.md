# TECHNICAL AUDIT REPORT: JANUARY 2026
**Auditor:** GitHub Copilot (Claude Opus 4.5)
**Date:** 3 January 2026
**Status:** ✅ HEALTHY (No Critical Issues)

---

## ✅ 1. RESOLVED: Tier Naming Consistency
**Status:** FIXED
**Location:** `types/subscriptions.ts`, `app/api/checkout/route.ts`, `app/api/webhook/route.ts`

The tier naming is now **fully consistent** across the codebase:
*   `AccountSubscription.tier`: `'architect' | 'visionary' | 'singularity'`
*   `PricingTier.name`: `'architect' | 'visionary' | 'singularity'`
*   `PRICING_TIERS`: Keys are `architect`, `visionary`, `singularity`
*   `checkout/route.ts`: Validates against `['architect', 'visionary', 'singularity']`
*   `webhook/route.ts`: Correctly casts to `'architect' | 'visionary' | 'singularity'`

**Pricing:**
*   Architect: $19/mo (3 sites, 5 refinements)
*   Visionary: $49/mo (10 sites, 30 refinements, code export)
*   Singularity: $199/mo (Unlimited, commercial license)

## 🏗️ 2. ARCHITECTURE: The "God Component"
**Severity:** MEDIUM (Maintenance Debt)
**Location:** `components/BuildFlowController.tsx` (~2013 lines)

### The Issue
This file has become a gravitational singularity for the frontend logic. It handles:
*   State Management (dozens of `useState`)
*   Iframe Rendering & Code Sanitization
*   Subscription Logic
*   UI Layout (Sidebar, Modals)
*   Routing & Auth Checks

### Risks
*   **Fragility:** A change to the subscription logic could break the iframe rendering.
*   **Performance:** Massive re-renders on small state changes.
*   **Cognitive Load:** Impossible for a human to reason about the entire flow.

### Recommendation
Refactor into smaller hooks and components:
1.  `useBuildState`: Extract state management.
2.  `SitePreviewFrame`: Extract the iframe logic into a pure component.
3.  `useSubscriptionGate`: Extract the tier checking logic.

## 👻 3. GHOST CODE: The "Singularity" Remnants
**Severity:** LOW (Bloat)
**Location:** `components/singularity/` & `app/api/`
**Last Verified:** 4 January 2026

### The Issue
The `components/singularity/` folder has been **cleaned up**. It now only contains:
*   `SingularitySidebar.tsx` (Active)
*   `SingularityTransition.tsx` (Active)
*   `TheWitness.tsx` (Active - used after deploy)
*   `ThinkingLog.tsx` (Active)
*   `VoidTransition.tsx` (Active - demo→builder transition)

The following legacy components have been **deleted**:
*   ~~`SingularityEngine.tsx`~~ (deleted 4 Jan)
*   ~~`TheDream.tsx`~~
*   ~~`TheSubconscious.tsx`~~
*   ~~`DirectLine.tsx`~~
*   ~~`HatchCharacter.tsx`~~

**API Routes - VERIFIED ACTIVE (Do NOT Delete):**
*   `app/api/chronosphere/` - Used by SectionBuilder, BuildFlowController for logging
*   `app/api/heal/` - Used by ErrorBoundary for auto-fix
*   `app/api/replicator/` - Used by ReplicatorModal

**Deleted API Routes:**
*   ~~`app/api/consciousness/`~~ (deleted)
*   ~~`app/api/direct-line/`~~ (deleted)

### Recommendation
These routes are active and in use. No cleanup needed here.

---

## 📋 4. API BLOAT
**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** `app/api/`

The API directory contains ~30 subdirectories. Many seem redundant (`generate`, `generate-stream`, `build-section`, `refine-section`).

### Recommendation
Consolidate generation logic into a single `app/api/engine` route with typed actions, rather than scattering logic across dozens of micro-routes.

## 📱 5. RECENT WORK: Mobile UI Polish
**Status:** IN PROGRESS (Unstaged Changes)

Recent changes in the diff:
*   `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`: Sidebar hidden on mobile, mobile nav added.
*   `app/dashboard/projects/page.tsx`: Mobile-responsive cards, touch-friendly buttons.
*   `app/dashboard/strategy/page.tsx`: Mobile-first layout for GTM page.
*   `components/BuildFlowController.tsx`: Fixed tier references (`lite` → `architect`).
*   `components/SectionBuilder.tsx`: Updated comment to reflect tier names.
*   `app/api/refine-section/route.ts`: Renamed `LITE_ARCHITECT_LIMIT` → `ARCHITECT_REFINEMENT_LIMIT`.

---

## ✅ SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS

1.  ~~**FIX THE MONEY LOOP:**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED.** Types are aligned.
2.  ~~**DELETE GHOST API ROUTES:**~~ ✅ **VERIFIED.** chronosphere/heal/replicator are ACTIVE.
3.  **REFACTOR BUILDER:** Break down `BuildFlowController` over time (Tech Debt).
4.  **Unstaged changes:** 3 files modified (demo/page.tsx, SectionBuilder.tsx, UserSync.tsx)
