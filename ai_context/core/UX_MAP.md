## 1. The Builder Core (`/builder`)

    - [x] `Start Over`: Must clear `localStorage` + ReseSt State + Redirect to `/builder`.
    - [x] `Go Home`: Must redirect to `/dashboard`.
    - [x] `View Brand`: Must open Brand Modal (if brand exists).
- [ ] **Section List (Sidebar)**
    - [ ] `Click`: Navigate to specific section (only if completed/current).
    - [ ] `Status Icons`: Checkmark (Done), Circle (Current), Lock (Future).
- [ ] **Mobile Menu**
    - [ ] `Toggle`: Smooth open/close.
    - [ ] `Responsiveness`: Must not overlap content on small screens.

### B. The Canvas (`SectionBuilder.tsx`)
- [x] **Input Stage**
    - [x] `Prompt Input`: Textarea expands/contracts.
    - [x] **Suggestions**:
        - [x] **Guest Trial**: Show 2 suggestions.
        - [x] **Pro/Agency**: Show 4 suggestions.
        - [x] **Unlock UI**: "Unlock Pro Suggestions" button when unsigned/guest.
    - [x] `Build Button`: Disabled if input is empty.
- [ ] **Generation Stage**
    - [ ] `Thinking Log`: Animations play smoothly.
    - [ ] `Error Handling`: If API fails, show "Retry" button (not white screen).

        - [x] **Agency**: Unlimited (∞).
    - [x] `Continue`: Saves section to DB -> Moves to next. **Guest can complete all sections before paywall; deploy/export/code remain locked.**

### C. The Preview (`FullSitePreviewFrame`)
- [x] **Rendering**: Uses `@babel/standalone` (Fixed Error #130).
- [x] **Icons**: Uses `LucideProxy` (Fixed crashes).

    - [x] `Section List`: Click to edit previous section.
    - [x] `Deploy/Export Buttons`:

        - [x] **Paid**: Triggers deploy/export normally.
    - [x] `Success Modal`: Shows live URL + "Next Steps".

## 2. The Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

### A. Sidebar (`DashboardLayout`)
- [x] **Navigation Links**: Removed broken links (Agents, Settings, etc.).

    - [x] `Delete`: Confirms before deleting. (Fixed: Now accepts ID).

## 3. Global Consistency

### A. Authentication
- [x] **Protected Routes**: `/builder`, `/dashboard` redirect to `/sign-in` if logged out (Handled by Clerk Middleware).
- [ ] **Auth State**: `useUser()` syncs correctly with `useSubscription()`.

### B. Monetization (Tier Logic)

## 4. Known Issues (To Fix)
1. [ ] **"God Component"**: `app/builder/page.tsx` is too large (3500+ lines). Needs refactor.
2. [ ] **Data Persistence**: `localStorage` is fragile. Move to Supabase-first sync.
3. [ ] **Preview Links**: Clicking a link in the preview iframe might navigate the iframe away from the preview.
