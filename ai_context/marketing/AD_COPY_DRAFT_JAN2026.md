## 🎯 Strategy: "The Anti-Builder"
*Most website builders are drag-and-drop hell. We are code-first, but faster.*

### Concept 1: The "Clean Code" Angle (Target: Developers)
**Headline:** Stop writing boilerplate. Start shipping.
**Body:** Describe your UI in plain English. Get clean, editable React + Tailwind code instantly. No drag-and-drop. Just code.
**CTA:** Build a Component (Free)

### Concept 2: The "MVP Speed" Angle (Target: Founders)
**Headline:** Your MVP is taking too long.
**Body:** HatchIt turns your ideas into deployed React apps in seconds. Professional design system included. Launch today, not next month.
**CTA:** Start Building

### Concept 3: The "Singularity" (Subtle Brand Play)

## 🧪 Reddit Ad Variants (for r/webdev, r/saas)

**Variant A (Problem/Solution):**
> **Title:** I built a tool that turns text into React components because I hate writing boilerplate.
> **Body:** It's called HatchIt. You type "Landing page for a coffee shop with a dark theme", and it generates the full React/Tailwind code. It's not a drag-and-drop builder. It's a code generator. Free to try.

**Variant B (Direct Value):**
> **Title:** Generate production-ready React components from text prompts.
> **Body:** No sign-up required to test. Uses a professional design system (Zinc/Inter). Great for quickly scaffolding landing pages or internal tools.
