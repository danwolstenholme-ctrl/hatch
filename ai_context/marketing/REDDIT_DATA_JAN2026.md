## Campaign Structure
- **Campaign Name:** `REDDIT_RESURRECTION`
- **Ad Group:** `AG_DEV_COMMUNITIES` (Likely targeting r/webdev, r/reactjs, r/saas, etc.)

## Analysis & Insights
1.  **Traffic Volume:** We drove significant traffic (~1.1k visitors) for a relatively low cost.
2.  **Efficiency:** A CPC of €0.22 is highly efficient. If we can maintain this while improving on-site conversion (via the new "Professional Studio" design), this channel is scalable.
3.  **Creative Context:** This campaign likely ran during the "Cyberpunk/Terminal" era. The new "Professional Studio" aesthetic might resonate better with professional developers who were previously bouncing due to the "toy-like" vibe.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Reactivate campaign with updated creative matching the new "Zinc/White" aesthetic.
- [ ] A/B test "Text-to-React" messaging vs "No Vendor Lock-in" messaging.
- [ ] Ensure landing page (Homepage) matches the promise of the ad.
