# Friends & Family Launch Messages

## Option 1: The "Excited Founder" (Best for close friends)
"Hey! 🥚 I just launched HatchIt v1. It’s an AI website builder that actually gives you the code (no lock-in). Built it in a single night with an AI co-founder. Would love if you could check it out and maybe give it a like/share! [Link]"

## Option 2: The "Casual" (Best for group chats)
"Finally shipped my side project. It's called HatchIt - lets you build websites by just talking to an AI. If anyone needs a landing page, give it a spin. [Link]"

## Option 3: The "Techie" (Best for dev friends)
"Just dropped HatchIt. It's a Next.js/Tailwind builder powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash. Unlike Framer/Wix, you own the code. Check out the 'Singularity' mode... it's kinda wild. [Link]"

## Option 4: The "Help Me Out" (Best for family)
"Big day! I just launched my new software product, HatchIt. It helps people build websites automatically. It would mean the world to me if you could click the link and share it with anyone who might need a website! [Link]"
