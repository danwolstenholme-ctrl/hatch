**Hour 1: The Problem**
Most website builders are a golden cage.
Easy to start, impossible to leave.

HatchIt is different.
We generate standard, maintainable code.
You own it. You host it. You scale it.

Freedom is a feature.

**Hour 2: The Stack**
Under the hood of every HatchIt site:
- Next.js 14
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI
- Lucide Icons

This isn't "generated spaghetti". It's the stack you would have chosen yourself.

**Hour 3: The Origin**
HatchIt v1 was built in a single night.
One solo founder. One AI collaborator.

This is the new velocity of software development.
We use our own tools. We move fast.
Join us.

**Hour 4: For Agencies**
Small agencies & freelancers:
Stop wasting billable hours on boilerplate.

Let HatchIt handle the V1.
You handle the polish and the client relationship.
Ship 10x faster. Keep 100% of the margin.

**Hour 5: The Workflow**
1. Describe your vision.
2. Watch the AI build it live.
3. Export the code.
4. `npm install && npm run dev`

It really is that simple.
Try it now: [Link]

**Hour 6: The Close**
The build session is complete. The product is live.
The future of web development isn't drag-and-drop.
It's prompt-and-own.
