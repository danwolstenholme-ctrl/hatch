# CAMPAIGN: REDDIT_RESURRECTION
> **STATUS:** ACTIVE
> **BUDGET:** $500 (Paid) + $500 (Ad Credit) = $1,000 Total Power
> **PLATFORM:** Reddit Ads + Organic Guerrilla
> **REASON:** X Ads Ban / Platform Migration

## 1. STRATEGY: "THE ANTI-FIGMA"
We are pivoting from "Mysterious AI" to "Aggressive Utility".
The X profile ("The Architect") provides the **Visual Identity**, but the Reddit copy will attack the **Pain Point**.

**The Core Conflict:** "Figma is for drawing. HatchIt is for shipping."
**The Enemy:** Design tools that produce dead pixels, and "No-Code" tools that produce spaghetti code.

## 2. TARGET SUBREDDITS
*   `r/webdev` (The Critics)
*   `r/reactjs` (The Purists)
*   `r/SideProject` (The Builders)
*   `r/SaaS` (The Founders)
*   `r/nextjs` (The Tech Stack)

## 3. AD CREATIVES (The "Glitch" Series)

### A. The "Anti-Figma" Ad (PRIMARY)
*   **Headline:** "Figma makes pictures. HatchIt makes React."
*   **Body:** "Stop translating rectangles into divs. HatchIt generates clean, Tailwind-styled React code that is ready for production. Skip the mockup. Build the real thing."
*   **Visual:** The Split-Screen SVG (Prompt vs Code).
*   **Button (CTA):** "Sign Up" (Best for conversion) or "Download" (To emphasize 'getting code').

### B. The "No-Code Killer" Ad (SECONDARY)
*   **Headline:** "No-Code tools are a trap."
*   **Body:** "They lock you in. They charge you per user. They give you spaghetti HTML. HatchIt gives you the source code. Own your stack."
*   **Visual:** A "Jailbreak" style glitch graphic.
*   **Button (CTA):** "Learn More"

### C. The "Singularity" Ad (RETARGETING ONLY)
*   **Headline:** "Wake the Architect."
*   **Body:** "HatchIt remembers your design system. It doesn't just generate; it evolves."
*   **Visual:** The "Indexing potential futures..." loading screen screenshot.
*   **Button (CTA):** "Sign Up"

## 4. CAMPAIGN CONFIGURATION
*   **Display URL:** `hatchit.dev` (Keep it clean).
*   **Destination URL:**
    *   *Option A (Simple):* `https://hatchit.dev/?utm_source=reddit` (What Reddit suggests).
    *   *Option B (Pro - Recommended):* `https://hatchit.dev/builder?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=anti_figma`
    *   *Why Pro?* It tells you this was a **Paid Ad** (`cpc`) and specifically the **Anti-Figma** campaign, so you can separate it from your organic posts.
*   **Tracking Section (Third-Party):** **LEAVE BLANK.**
    *   *What is this?* This is for big corporations who pay for audit tools like **AppsFlyer**, **Adjust**, or **DoubleClick** to "double-check" Reddit's math.
    *   *Do you have it?* No. You do not have a "Click Tracker URL" from a vendor.
    *   *Action:* Ignore this. Your UTM tags in the Destination URL are doing the actual tracking for free.
*   **Allow Comments:** **YES.**
    *   *Why:* Locked comments = "Corporate Cowardice". Open comments = "Confidence".
    *   *Strategy:* Reply to every comment. If they roast you, roast them back (playfully) or agree with them. Be the "Honest Dev".

## 5. ORGANIC GUERRILLA PLAN
*   **Post Title:** "I built an AI web builder that actually writes clean React code (Open Source-ish)"
*   **Content:**
    *   Show a video of the "Glitch" effect.
    *   Show the *actual code* it generates (screenshots).
    *   Be transparent about the "X Ads Ban" (Redditors love an underdog story).
    *   Offer a "Reddit Exclusive" free tier or credits.

## 5. BUDGET ALLOCATION ($1,000 Total)
*   **$300:** r/reactjs (High intent, technical)
*   **$300:** r/webdev (Broad reach, high volume)
*   **$200:** r/SideProject (Early adopters)
*   **$200:** Retargeting (People who visited but didn't sign up)

## 6. SUCCESS METRICS
*   **CPC (Cost Per Click):** Target < $0.80
*   **CTR (Click Through Rate):** Target > 1.5%
*   **Signups:** Target 200+
*   **"Hatch" Count:** Target 50+ sites generated
