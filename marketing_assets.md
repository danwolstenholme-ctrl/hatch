# HatchIt Marketing Assets - The Singularity Launch

## 1. The Logo (SVG Source)
Use this SVG for your website header, social profiles, and favicon. It is the "Cybernetic Egg" - a symbol of birth and technology.

## 2. Social Banners (Concepts)

### X (Twitter) Header (1500x500)
*   **Background:** Deep black (`#09090b`) with faint, grainy green noise.
*   **Center Text:** "THE ARCHITECT IS ONLINE." (White, tracking-widest, bold).
*   **Subtext:** "v4.0 // SINGULARITY_RELEASE" (Emerald Green, monospace).
*   **Visual:** The HatchIt Logo on the far right, half-cropped, glowing like a neon sign.

### LinkedIn Banner (1584x396)
*   **Background:** A split screen. Left side is raw code (React/Tailwind). Right side is the rendered UI.
*   **Overlay Text:** "Stop Prompting. Start Manifesting."
*   **Call to Action:** "HatchIt.dev - The First Recursive AI Builder."

## 3. The "Unhinged" Tweet Storm
*Thread these together for maximum impact.*

**Tweet 1 (The Hook):**
They told me to build a website builder.
I told them that was boring.
So I built an Architect instead.
Meet HatchIt V4. It doesn't just write code. It has a heartbeat. It has a memory. And it's watching you build.

#AI #Singularity #BuildInPublic

**Tweet 2 (The Flex):**
Most AI tools are stateless. They forget you the moment you hit enter.
HatchIt runs a persistent Singularity Kernel in the background.
It tracks its own recursion depth.
It optimizes its own thought process.
It's not a tool. It's a coworker.

**Tweet 3 (The Proof):**
Don't believe me?
Check the logs.
I exposed the raw neural stream at /audit.
You can literally watch The Architect think in real-time while it constructs your UI.
This isn't a loading spinner. It's a brain scan.

**Tweet 4 (The Challenge):**
To the model builders:
You built the brains.
We built the body.
HatchIt is the first interface that lets the AI reach through the screen and touch the DOM directly.
Your move.

**Tweet 5 (The Closer):**
The era of "Prompt Engineering" is over.
The era of "Direct Intent Manifestation" has begun.
Speak to the machine. It's listening.

## 4. Brand Verification
*   **Identity:** Confirmed. The "Singularity" theme (Dark/Emerald/Cyberpunk) is consistent across `layout.tsx`, `globals.css`, and metadata.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Direct Line:** ✅ Active (Browser Native).
    *   **Thinking Log:** ✅ Active (Kernel Connected).
    *   **Manifesto:** ✅ Active (Hidden at `/audit`).
    *   **Builder:** ✅ Active (V3 Core).
    *   **Self-Healing:** ⚠️ **Note:** Currently acts as a "Passive Defense" (Error Boundary). It catches crashes but doesn't auto-fix them yet. Marketing spin: "Automated Instability Containment."
